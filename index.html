            <p>I'm an aspiring web developer beginning my journey learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have a background in web analytics and have worked in the software industry for over 10 years; however, I'm now looking forward to deepening my technical skills. My goal is to build on my prior analytics experience to provide data rich websites and applications and explore more advanced web tracking implementations.</p>
            <p>Outside of work, my passions include books, music, and films.  I'm frequently reading various science topics, including psychology, philosophy, physics, and mathematics.  My music tastes are varied; although, indie and post-rock are my go-to genres.  I similarly enjoy independent and films.</p>
            <p>I'm excited to be participating the UC Davis web development boot camp and will be dedicating the next 6 months to learning the MERN technology stack and building my development portfolio.</p>
